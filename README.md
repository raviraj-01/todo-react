# Project Title: iTask - Todo List Application

## Description:
iTask is a simple and intuitive Todo List application built using React.js. This project allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and track the completion of their tasks. It features persistent storage using localStorage, ensuring your tasks are saved even after refreshing or reopening the browser.This is my first project in React, created as part of my journey into learning and understanding modern frontend development.

### Through this project, I explored and applied core React concepts such as:

• Components
• React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
• Props and state management
• Event handling
• Working with localStorage for data persistence

### The app allows users to:

• Add new tasks
• Edit existing tasks
• Mark tasks as completed or not
• Delete tasks
• Filter to view only completed or all tasks
